# Mission-to-Mars
# Overview of the Project
With this project, we were able to portray how to scrape information from dieferent websites, the latest mars news from NASA's website, Mars facts from the Space Facts, images of Mar's Hemispheres from Astrology.We were also able to make the website a mobile compatible using Bootstrap 
# Resources:
- Data Source : Mission_to_Mars.ipynb, app,py, scraping.py, index.html
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python, MongoDB, VS Code, Flask.

# Results:
We were able to create a functional web app for Robin that was scraping-friendly, was able to adjust the web app to include all four of the hemisphere images using BeautifulSoup and splinter to be able to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of those images, and was also able to store the scraped data on a Mongo database and finally use web application to display data as well as altering the design of the web app to accomodate the images and mobile capable.

# Summary:
We automated a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars, stored it in a NoSQL database and then was able to render the data in a web application created with flask. With web scraping, we were able to extract online data for analysis.
